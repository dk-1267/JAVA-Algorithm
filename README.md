## Included Algorithms 📂
Here's a sneak peek at the categories of algorithms you'll find in this project:

 ### Graphs
  This category includes algorithms for traversing and searching through graph structures. These algorithms are fundamental for understanding how to navigate and manipulate graph data       structures, which are widely used in computer science for modeling relationships and connections.

 ### Sorting
  Sorting algorithms are essential for arranging data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. This category covers various sorting techniques, each with its own advantages     and use cases, helping you understand the trade-offs between different sorting methods.

 ### Trees
  Tree algorithms focus on operations related to tree data structures, such as binary search trees. These algorithms are crucial for efficiently managing hierarchical data and performing    operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
 
 ### Shortest path
  Shortest path algorithms are used in graph theory to find the path between two nodes (vertices) in a graph that minimizes the total weight (cost, distance, or time).  
 
 ### MST
  Minimum spanning tree algorithms are used to find a subset of edges in a weighted graph that connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight, without forming cycles.

 ### Maximum flow
  Maximum flow algorithms determine the greatest amount of flow that can pass from a source node to a sink node in a flow network, while respecting capacity constraints on the edges.
